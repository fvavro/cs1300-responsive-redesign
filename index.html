        <h2>Website Selection</h2>
        <p>
          For my project, I have chosen the Brown Ballroom Dance website:
          <a
            href="https://brownballroom.wixsite.com/brownballroom/about"
            target="_blank"
            >Brown Ballroom Dance</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a ballroom dancer myself, I have often found it challenging to find
          information on websites from different teams, which are usually more
          confusing than helpful. I believe this website is currently extremely
          minimal in design and has a lot of untapped potential.

      <section id="current-website-analysis">
        <h2>Current Website Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          This website has a very simple structure, which does make it rather
          easy to navigate and learn. However:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is hard to find precise information; the only detailed dropdown
            is for Brown Comp.
          </li>
          <li>
            The home page is not functional, missing a lot of information and
            potential for announcements and news.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no memorability or impression of the team given to the
            user.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="accessibility">
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          Surprisingly, the website is quite accessible. It has many labels, and
          since it is black and white, the contrast is sufficient. However, it
          sometimes contains text that is too small and is missing a few labels
          and proper organization of lists.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>

        <section id="initial-goals-and-flaws">
          <h3>Initial Goals and Flaws</h3>
          <p>The initial goals of the redesign were to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Improve the overall navigability of the website.</li>
            <li>
              Make the homepage more functional by adding sections for
              announcements and news.
            </li>
            <li>Create a memorable impression of the team.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Through sketching and analysis, these goals were refined to focus on
            creating an easily navigable web experience for both new and
            experienced ballroom dancers, and incorporating opportunities for
            users to stay informed and engaged.

            Here are some initial sketches that outline the proposed redesign of
            the website. The focus was on improving navigation, making the

            After refining the sketches, I created high-fidelity prototypes
            using Figma. These prototypes are designed to be responsive,
            ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices. Key
            features proposed in the Figma prototype include:

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The redesigned Brown Ballroom Dance website offers a more functional
          and visually appealing interface. By focusing on accessibility,
          usability, and responsive design, the new website provides a better
          platform for the team to share information and engage with visitors.
          The integration of various plug-in opportunities, such as Google
          Calendar, email subscriptions, social media links, and an
          announcements window, enhances the user experience and keeps the
          community well-informed and connected.
